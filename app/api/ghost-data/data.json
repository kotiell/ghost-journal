This gives rise to the following test: stand in a room with a hiding spot (but not in the hiding spot) and away from the ghost room, and check its speed when it hunts; if it runs quickly to the nearest player and slows to a crawl as it approaches, then it is a Deogen. Note that others ghosts like the Thaye could be very fast under certain conditions; carry a smudge stick to prevent death in case it is not a Deogen.\nIf the player asks any question through the Spirit Box while standing within 1 metre of the Deogen, it has a 33% chance with each question to produce a unique response of constant heavy bull-like breathing, instead of a regular response.

Similarly, a ghost which has not changed its favourite room after a long time could (but not definitely) be a Goryo.",

Keep the fuse box turned on, and listen for its footsteps during a hunt; if it is very fast in its ghost room but slower outside (where temperatures are warmer), then it is probably a Hantu. Alternatively, turn the fuse box off, then listen out for its footsteps over several hunts.\nThe Hantu will never turn on the fuse box; a ghost doing so eliminates the possibility of it being a Hantu.\nThe Hantu will emit freezing breath when its ghost model is visible during a hunt as long as the fuse box is turned off.",

This can be tested by standing at the end of a long hallway or room, then waiting for the ghost to achieve LoS from the other end. If its speed increases instantly and not over a period of time, then it is likely a Jinn. Be careful not to confuse this with the Revenant; the Jinn's speed is normal if it is not chasing a player, unlike the Revenant.\nThe Jinn has an ability to instantly decrease the sanity of all players in the same room or otherwise within 3 metres by 25%. This will give an EMF reading at the fuse box. Leave an EMF reader by the fuse box; if it rings but the fuse box did not turn on/off, then it is likely the Jinn using its ability.\nThe Jinn will never turn off the fuse box; a ghost doing so eliminates the possibility of it being a Jinn.

When a player is cursed, their sanity drain doubles, and cannot be stopped by lights. The curse is paused temporarily when players are outside the investigation area, and Sanity Pills remove the curse for a player. After a player receives a spirit box response, keep track of the sanity of all players; if one person's sanity drops noticeably quicker than others, then it is likely a Moroi.On Nightmare difficulty, after receiving a spirit box response, the questioner should immediately return to the van and consume sanity pills to reach maximum sanity, hold a lit candle going back in, then receive another response from the spirit box, wait about 30 seconds, then finally return to the van again and attempt to eat another sanity pill. If the player can eat a sanity pill (barring any ghost events or other abilities), then it is probably a Moroi. Some ghosts such as the Yurei or Jinn can drop the sanity of nearby players; try to eliminate this as a possibility.\n\nThe Moroi becomes faster as the average sanity becomes lower. If the ghost speeds up over several hunts, then it could be a Moroi. Note that the Hantu can speed up if the fuse box is off over several hunts, so ensure that the fuse box remains turned on.\nWhen smudged during a hunt, the duration where the Moroi cannot see nor kill players is at 12 seconds, twice as long as the usual 6 seconds.",

This will return to normal on the next flicker, and will happen at least once per hunt.\nWhen the Obake interacts with a surface that allows for fingerprints, there is a 75% chance that it will leave fingerprints, as opposed to the standard 100% chance for all other ghosts. Seperately, Obake may also use an ability that halves the remaining duration of existing fingerprints on the map, potentially causing them to disappear within seconds of appearing. If the ghost touches two different surfaces, and leaves fingerprints on one but not another (or the fingerprint disappears much quicker than 2 minutes after the touch), then it is an Obake.",

This will also never appear if the ghost is an Oni.\n\nOnis will be visible for a longer period when flickering during hunts. Seeing a ghost that doesnt disappear as often as other ghosts during a hunt gives it out as an Oni.",

In addition, the Onryo will prioritize blowing out a flame instead of using a crucifix. Hence, an Onryo can be tested for by placing a crucifix down, and having multiple lit candles in close proximity; if the candles repeatedly go out without the ghost ever hunting nor the crucifix ever burning, even at low average sanity, the ghost may be an Onryo. On the other hand, if the crucifix burns without any nearby candle being extinguished, the ghost is not an Onryo.",

In a ghost event, if the ghost disappeared as the picture was taken but his footsteps and vocalizations can still be heard, it means that it is a Phantom.The ghost's physical image will not be visible in the picture found in the journal, but will be labelled as a \"Ghost\" picture. Additionally, the image will appear without any electronic interference. However, any ghost can have the same effect if the photo is taken right at the end of a ghost event; be sure that the ghost event is still ongoing even when the ghost has disappeared.\n\nDuring a hunt, a Phantom will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds as opposed to every 0.3 to 1 seconds for other ghosts. Watch for the ghost's flickering rate; if it is invisible for longer periods of time, it is a Phantom.",
    "Other possible identifiers": "The Phantom has an ability similar to the Wraith's, which it can use (not during a manifestation) to walk to a random player's location regardless of distance. After this, the Phantom will continue normal activity. This is more useful on large maps; if the ghost interacts or hunts near a player who is very far from the ghost room, it could be a Phantom."

However, this may easily go unnoticed if players are strictly focused on investigating in or around the ghost room, as the decoy Twin could possibly be far away from the \"main\" Twin. Leaving an active EMF reader inside the ghost room while doing something else might potentially help players identify Twins if an interaction is noticed somewhere and the EMF reader is heard going off inside the ghost room at the same time.\nEach Twin has a different moving speed during hunts. The main Twin will be 10% slower than the standard ghost speed while the secondary Twin will be 10% faster. Noticing a subtle change in speed from one hunt to another might be an indicator of The Twins.",
    "Other possible identifiers": "As the name implies, The Twins effectively appears to be two separate entities, though code-wise it is only one. The \"main\" Twin can provide all three pieces of evidence, while the \"decoy\" Twin can only give EMF Level 5, and cannot be detected with motion sensors. Noticing multiple disturbances far away from the ghost room but failing to get any response on the Spirit Box or reading any significant temperature drop in the vicinity is a likely indicator of the decoy Twin causing disturbances.Similarly, if there are motion sensors nearby, noticing interactions occuring in the area but without the motion sensor ever being set off is a potential sign that it is the decoy Twin.\nNote that interactions for all ghosts happen in a radius confined to the same floor. This means that any ghost could interact through the wall. Having two interactions at reasonably different times in adjacent rooms does not necessarily indicate that the ghost is The Twins.\n\nIf Twins are suspected, searching around the building for items that have been displaced or thrown on the floor or lights that have been unexpectedly turned on far away from the ghost room might help narrow down the ghost type. Note that this is more useful before the ghost has had the chance to hunt; ghosts can throw objects during hunts, so be careful not to be misled.\nWhen The Twins attempt to initate a hunt, there is a 50% chance of it to occur at the main Twin, and a 50% chance for it to occur from the decoy Twin. This means that The Twins can hunt while they are far from one another. Noticing a hunt starting unusually far away from the ghost room or multiple hunts each occuring in vastly different locations might be a sign of The Twins.Crucifixes will only check for the main Twin when blocking hunts, regardless of which location the ghost is attempting to hunt from."
